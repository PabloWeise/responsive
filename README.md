# responsive

This was a time consuming project, never the less, I think the outcome is good (youll let me know).
Started buy building my main index.html . Fixed a nav bar at the top and made it responsive (everything is responsive). Continued applying rows and colums inside containers for structure and gave it a background.
For my portafolio I made a row with different colums and added buttons. Each screen size has a different value for colums and when it will get to Xs the pictures will apear in one colum.
For the contact page, I added a container and gave it rows and colums to build a table (with the span of 6 colums). The other 6 colums i added placeholders, and inputs so some one could add their info to reach me.
For the Css, I only used one css sheet ( which now i know maybe its better for every individual html to have its own, or just deferentiate my clases better.) For things i wanted to style a little bit different i used style in the clases (In the portafolio images), till i got the result i wanted.
It was entertaining building the portafolio and cant wait to code more.
